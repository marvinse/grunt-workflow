# grunt-workflow
Simple and full example of Grunt automation

In this example we can be able to compile all SASS files in a single CSS, and uglify all javascript files in one JS file.

Every task is divided into a JS file, for keep a maintainable project in Grunt JS.

An interesting thing is that we have a server with express that give us the opportunity to use live reload, and if we change some CSS, JS or HTML in our dev folder, it will refresh automatically our prod environment
